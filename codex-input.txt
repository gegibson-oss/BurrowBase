Update the site navigation and product framing as follows:

Navigation:
- Remove "Home" from the nav
- Remove "Apply" as a standalone nav item
- Add a top-level "Product" dropdown with:
  - Automated Reviews → /reviews
  - Digital Operations Manager™ → /digital-operations-manager
- Keep "Pricing" as a top-level item
- Add "How It Works" linking to /how-it-works
- Keep "Login" as a top-level item

Right-side CTAs:
- Primary button: "Start Free" → /start
- Secondary text link: "Apply" → /apply

Important framing rules:
- Digital Operations Manager™ is a software product + managed service, NOT a job or position
- The /digital-operations-manager page should describe the product, outcomes, and who it’s for
- The "Apply" flow is a qualification + purchase step, not a job application
- Keep the existing Apply checkout/payment link intact
- Do not use employment language (job, role, position, hiring, candidate)

Do not change page content yet beyond navigation labe corrections.
