# HOME PAGE (`/`)

## Hero
**Headline:** Calm operations for businesses that serve real customers.  
**Subhead:** Burrow Base installs a focused system that keeps reviews steady, operations quiet, and owners out of the weeds.

**Primary CTA:** Start Free  
**Secondary CTA:** See Reviews

## Problem
**Title:** Most businesses don’t need more tools. They need fewer fires.  
**Body:** Reviews slip, follow-ups stall, and owners end up doing the work. Burrow Base installs the smallest system that keeps the daily operation running without constant oversight.

## System Explanation
**Title:** A simple system. Installed for you.  
**Body:** We start with Automated Reviews, then expand into full operational management when you are ready. Each layer is calm, focused, and designed to reduce noise.

## Product Entry Cards
**Card 1: Automated Reviews**  
**Copy:** Review requests that go out on time, follow up once, and surface issues before they become public.

**Card 2: Digital Operations Manager™**  
**Copy:** A managed operating system that replaces manual follow-up and scattered tools. Owners see only exceptions.

## Upgrade Path
**Title:** Start narrow. Expand only when you need it.  
**Body:** Begin with reviews. Add scheduling, payments, and full operations later without rebuilding your setup.

## CTA
**Title:** Start with Reviews.  
**Body:** A clean, focused product that takes five minutes to set up.

**Primary CTA:** Start Free  
**Secondary CTA:** Apply
